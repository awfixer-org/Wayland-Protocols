    <description summary="map EI regions to compositor space">
      This global can be used by clients to associate EI mapping ids from
      ei_device.region_mapping_id events with compositor regions.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

      <description summary="create a wl_output association">
        This event associates a wl_output with a region mapping id.

        When this global is initially bound, the compositor emits this event for
        each output global. The client can use wl_display.sync to ensure that it
        has received all events.

        Afterwards, the compositor emits this event when the mapping for an
        output changes or a new output global appears.
